This project is written for a numerical curse in university. It solves the poisson-equation numerically by using bunemann-algorithm.
The given application is to calculate the deformation of a plate if a weight of a special shape is placed on it. 

The files ending ".m" are, as usual, for matlab or octave (written for octave, hence I don't garantee for workin in matlab). At the moment do not use them! They all work correctly, but the problem is solved only using Gaus-Seidel-algorithm which is VERY bad for this problem.

The files "them41main.pdf" contains theoretical background [in german only].
